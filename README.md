# Experima

Experima is a platform that help researchers to build behavioral reseearch with ease, flexibility, and security in hand.

## Feature

- User's don't need to know any programming (simply drag and drop, fill form)
- Your experiment data is totally secure
- Experiment feature (random assignment, pre-testing)
- Analytics (not sure yet, which kind of analytics will be put)
- Connect to Amazon Mechanical Turk (Participant and Payment)
  - or maybe we can accept another pool participant platform channel

## Existing Solution

- Amazon Mechanical Turk
  - Functionality of designing experiment in AMT is quite limited
  - Not specific for conducting behavioral research.
- oTree <http://www.otree.org/>
  - You need to do some programming, handling database, etc which also mean to handle your security by yourself.
  - They do provide some existing behavioral experiment template
  - Multiplayer game --> sounds cool
  - Demo on how its work, see <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_Z9AM7PfdI>
  - A paper they publish about the platform, see <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214635016000101>
  - It's a open source, but done with phyton
- prolific <https://prolific.ac>
  - Provide pool participants like Amazon Mechanical Turk
  - Demo on how its work, see <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=razqzJy7aSA>
  - A paper they publish <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214635017300989>
  - They still used different system to design the experiment, and system are not handle the data integrity very well.

## Our plan

1. Select one of the real case study to implement.
2. Make a MVP for those case study.
3. Maybe we can also write an article for this platform.

## Challenge

1. Cater all possibility of experiment design and offer it with ease.
2. Monetizing? Maintenance cost?
